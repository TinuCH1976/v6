# Advanced Access Manager v6
This repository is going to be used to rethink the Advanced Access Manager WordPress plugin project. Here I'm going to commit the development progress for the next generation for WordPress authentication, authorization and monitoring set of tools that collectively will be referred to AAM.

## Basic vision
My main objective is to split already really big, monolithic AAM application into bunch of small modules that can be enabled, disabled or downloaded on demand.

Besides, there will be a clear differentiation between backend (PHP) code and frontend (HTML, JS & CSS) code.
